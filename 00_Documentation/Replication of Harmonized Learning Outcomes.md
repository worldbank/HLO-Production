## Replicating this Repository

This repository contains all materials necessary to replicate the collection of Harmonized Learning Outcomes (HLO). To replicate it, you will need Stata to execute the code. All code necessary to replicate our datasets is contained in this repository. However, the raw microdata from the learning assessments is not made available here. World Bank collaborators may access this data through _datalibweb_, while external researchers should download the raw microdata directly from the organizers of the learning assessments.


We did intentionally leave the `input` flexible, so that external researchers wishing to replicate and adapt this code can do so with minimal adaptation required. All the code is automatically rendered by GitHub, so you can immediately inspect the code by navigating the folders.

To replicate, first execute [profile_MHC_HLO_Production.do](https://github.com/worldbank/MHC-HLO-Production/blob/main/profile_MHC-HLO-Production.do). 
Then execute [run.do](https://github.com/worldbank/MHC-HLO-Production/blob/main/run.do)

### Bug reports and feature requests

An easy but still very efficient way to provide any feedback on this repository that does not require any GitHub knowledge is to create an *issue*. You can read *issues* submitted by other users or create a new *issue* [here](https://github.com/worldbank/MHC-HLO/issues). While the word *issue* has a negative connotation outside GitHub, it can be used for any kind of feedback. If you have an idea for a new analysis or would like to report an error, creating an *issue* is a great tool for communicating that to us. Please read already existing *issues* to check whether someone else has made the same suggestion or reported the same error before creating a new *issue*.
